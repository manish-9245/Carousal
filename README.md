Picture this: a world of utter chaos, where shadows beg for secrets, borrow enigmatic whispers, and steal glimpses into the unknown. The stakes are high, and you navigate the fine line between strategy and mayhem, where creativity is your currency, and cunning is your compass.

Greetings PFTians,

We've been cooking up something truly special, something that will leave you all in delightful disbelief. So, don’t jump the gun just yet, as we do have something coming up in just a day's time.

But here's the twist – we're not going to reveal it just yet.
Because, where's the fun in that?!

For now, all we can say is that you won't want to miss what's coming. Keep your curiosity piqued and your calendars open to see what’s headed your way.

Venue: EGL Central Garden

Stay tuned…
